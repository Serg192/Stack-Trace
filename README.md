# Stack Trace 
**Pet project for learning full-stack web development with Spring Boot + React**

Stack Trace is a platform that serves as a community-driven question-and-answer (Q&A) 
forum for programming and software development-related topics. The platform is currently 
in development, and very few features are actually implemented. 

This project is a rework of the [usof-front](https://github.com/Serg192/usof-front) project.
